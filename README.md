Exercism Rust Exercises
-----------------------

Definitely recommend [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) to anyone looking to learn a new language.


### Journey

#### [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
I started my journey with Rustlings.
You basically get general syntax in just a few minutes, if you are familiar with [Curly-Bracket Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Curly-bracket_languages).
You also start to get the hint that memory management is going to be challenging, but only a hint.

#### [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
Ughhh. A necessary, but painful, step for me. 
Advent of Code is awesome; trying to do [AoC 2021 in Rust](https://github.com/samterrell/aoc-2021) was sobering.
Give it a try. 
You will learn very quickly that Rust is not syntax nor a static code analysis engine nor an ecosystem.
Rust is an opportunity to truely learn, which is a protracted challenge, more like learning calculas for the first time than an iPhone.
One does not see the large community then switch and assume things will just work out.

#### [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)
All caught up.
The Forth challenge pretty much broke me, though.
I got it doing what I thought an interpreter should do, after being forced to learn `RefCell` and `Rc` (interior mutability pattern).
Still several tests do not pass, because Forth is a silly language that lets you redefine addition (generally, not overloading).


#### [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book)
I recommend getting the print edition.
I definitely needed this, and am still working my way through the book.
Between Exercism and The Book, I feel I can brute force my way through any problem.
From here out, I believe it's mostly practice/experience.
